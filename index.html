    <div><h2>Career Goal:</h2></div>
    <p>Sometime personal career goals are hard to achieve. As I grew older I started to realize what I have to accomplish in our life and career.
        For example,as you hit high school, you have to start to think about what you want to pursue when you are older. I want to pursue a career
        in the medical field. I have also thought of becoming some sort of Engineer. As a Engineer, I would become an architectural Engineer. In the
        medical field I would become a Veterinary Doctor. These are my career goals for my life. My plans for achieving these goals are to study
        different things at once. Stem majors are required to know a lot of different things. Such as, science, math, computer courses, etc. This is
        my career choices because my dad and I talked about future career choices and we decided something in the medical field would suit me. I did
        research and potentially chose to become a Veterinary Doctor. I would pursue a Bachelor's degree of Animal Sciences. Engineering would sort
        of be a back-up choice for me. If I were to pursue Engineering, I would hold a Bachelor's degree of Engineering. This is a back-up choice for
        me because this is also something I like. To sum it up, these would be some of my career choices and goals.</p>
    <p>

        

        <div><h2>Strengths and Personal qualities:</h2></div>
        <p> I am Adaptable, Cooperative,and Flexible. These characteristics that I posses help me in my career because being able to work
            in any conditions, being able to work with people, and working in different conditions are all skillful for being in a Medical
        field or in a Engineering field. Throughout school, I have shown cooperation with peers and I have show responsibility. I am able
    to work well with other people and I care about my work. Throughout group projects, I would ensure that my part of the project would be
complete. In Highschool, I joined clubs that were important to me. I joined the American Cancer Society club along with the help for the home
less club. I enjoyed joining these clubs because they were a good way for me to get my mind off of school. I also joined the Soccer Team.
Playing soccer was always something that I wanted to do. I also got principal honor roles every year and I got awarded best person in high
school. I've learned that I do work better by-myself but I can work as good with other people. While being on the soccer team I realized that
I had to put my best effort to actually do good in the team. While doing an Internship I realized that doing a job isn't as easy as everyone
says it is. I realized how much time and effort goes into a work-job and I ready to commit. </p>
        
    
    <div><h2>Conclusion:</h2></div>
    <p> To sum it up, throughout my Highschool years I realized what I wanted to pursue in life. Being in the medical field would be one of the
        best things that has happened to me. I work good with others which is a very important part of being in the medical field because of the
        shared roles that the Doctors and Nurses have to do. I've realized what I have to do in a work career and how much effort I have to put into
        this. I personally thank everyone who took their time to read my about me site. Please feel free to look at the other things on my website.
        Thank You.
